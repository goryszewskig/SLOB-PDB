Version
-------
SLOB 2.4.0


NEW IN THIS RELEASE
-------------------
* Short Table Scans. This release introduces the ability to direct SLOB sessions to perform 
a percentage of all SELECT statements as full table scans against a small, non-indexed table. 
However, the size of the "scan table" is configurable.

* Statspack Support. This version, by default, generates STATSPACK reports instead of 
Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) reports. This means that SLOB testing can be conducted 
against Oracle Database editions that do not support AWR--as well as the ability 
to test Enterprise Edition with fewer software licensing concerns. AWR reports can be generated 
after a simple modification to the slob.conf file.

* External Script Execution. House-keeping of test results files and the ability to, for example, 
issue a remote command to a storage array to commence data collection is introduced by the 
EXTERNAL_SCRIPT feature in SLOB 2.4.

ADDITIONAL CHANGES
------------------
SLOB 2.4 has been tested on public cloud configurations to include Amazon Web Services RDS for Oracle. 
The changes in SLOB 2.4 to slob.conf parameters, and other infrastructure, makes SLOB 2.4 
the cloud predictability and repeatability testing tool of choice as of SLOB 2.4.

ADDITIONAL INFO
---------------
Please see the SLOB 2.4 documentation in the SLOB/doc directory.

ATTRIBUTIONS
-----------
Users in the SLOB user community assisted with this release with non-trivial contributions. I'd like to
say thanks, and give proper attribution, to the following SLOB users for their help:

	* Chris Osborne (@westendwookie): 
		Chris provided a functional prototype of the new SLOB 2.4 Scan Table Feature. 
		Thanks, Chris!
	* Christian Antognini (@ChrisAntognini): 
		Chris provided a functional prototype of the new SLOB 2.4 support for statspack! 
		Thanks, Chris!
	* James Morle (@JamesMorle): 
		James has helped with several scalability improvements in slob.sql based on his 
		astonishing high-end SLOB testing. With thousands of sessions attached to a dozen 
		or more state-of-the-art Xeon hosts connected to NVM storage led to several issues 
		with proper start/stop synchronization and thus reduced repeatability. James also 
		created the new SLOB 2.4 EXTERNAL_SCRIPT feature. As always, thanks, James!
	* Maciej Przepiorka (@mPrzepiorka): 
		Maciej conducted very thorough Beta testing and enhanced the EXTERNAL_SCRIPT feature 
		in SLOB 2.4. Thanks, Maciej.
	* Martin Berger (@martinberx): 
		Martin conducted significant Standard Edition testing and also enhanced the 
		SLOB/misc/awr_info.sh (SLOB/misc/statspack_info.sh) script for producing performance 
		data in tuple form from statspack. Thanks, Martin!
